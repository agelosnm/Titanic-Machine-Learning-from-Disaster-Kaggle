# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster-Kaggle
The Titanic challenge in Kaggle is a competition in which the task is to predict the survival or the death of a given passenger based on a set of features. I am new in data science & machine learning field and I made this little project as a start off to have a better hands-on understanding of ML. I managed to achieved 0.78947 on the public leaderboard of this competition and my goal is to get a better score.

  This project requires some data cleaning as not all of the given data are useful and the right ML algorithm to take the best possible predictions. I used the most common ML algorithms (linear regression, k-means, svc etc.) and  I observed that random forest classifier is the best ML algorithm for this problem, and then using grid search method I achieved a better score by optimizing the parameters of the model.
