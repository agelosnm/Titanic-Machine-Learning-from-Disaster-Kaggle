# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster-Kaggle
The Titanic challenge in Kaggle is a competition in which the task is to predict the survival or the death of a given passenger based on a set of features. I am new in data science & machine learning field and I made this little project as a start off to have a better hands-on understanding of ML. I managed to achieve nearly the score of 79% on the public leaderboard of the competition and my goal is to get a better score.

  Of course, this project requires some data cleaning before these pass to the model as not all of the given data are useful and some feature engineering to extract as more information about the dataset as possible. I used the most common ML algorithms (linear regression, k-means, svc etc.) and I observed that random forest classifier works better than any other algorithm for this problem and then by using the grid search method I achieved a better score by optimizing the parameters of the model.
