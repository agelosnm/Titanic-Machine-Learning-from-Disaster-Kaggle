# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster-Kaggle
The Titanic challenge in Kaggle is a competition in which the task is to predict the survival or the death of a given passenger based on a set of features. I am new in data science & machine learning field and I made this little project as a start off for me to have a better hands-on understanding of ML. 

  Of course, this project requires some data cleaning and feature engineering as not all of the given data are useful. I used the most common ML algorithms (linear regression, k-means, svc etc.) and I observed that random forest classifier works better than any other algorithm for this problem, and then by using the grid search method I achieved a better score by optimizing the parameters of the model.
